# adco_tkinter

This is the second version of the inventory management application for The Albany Distilling Company. In this version I changed the SQLite database to a MYSQL database hosted through AWS. I re-wrote most, if not every SQL statement and added functionality to download/upload Dropbox files. Again, I felt the security of the application wasn't sufficient. I then created a web-application using Flask (Python web framework) which code can be viewed under "adco_flask"
